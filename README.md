This is my semester project for MATH 442, Stochastic Operations Research.

My team and I created a monte carlo simulation based off of 4 different mock securities. The simulation specifies what percent of the portfolio should belong to each stock, and returns the excpeted gain/loss after 10 years.
There is also a presentation summarizing our results and our rationale behind our reccomendation.
